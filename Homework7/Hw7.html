    <h3>
        I created a ratio looking at number of foreigners with undergraduate degrees to the total number of people with undergraduate degrees per 1000 undergraduate degrees across all 50 US states. 
        I wanted to see what states had higher proportions and then try to come up with reasons as to why some states had significantly higher proportions than others.
